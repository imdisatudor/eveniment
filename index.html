	<h2>Our Story</h2>
	
	<div class="rand">
		<section class="sectiune"><p>When she was 7, Diana Stan was placed in foster care, after the loss of both her parents and also her dog. Growing up, she had a dream – she wanted to be a famous singer. However, the children in the system were not given the chance to make their dreams come true. So she was forced to pursue another path.<br><br>At 23 years old, she married rich. Real rich. Her husband, Count Reginald Wolfshire, 52, dedicated his life to making his young and beautiful countess happy. So when she wanted to help the children in the system make their dreams come true, the two immediately started organizing the first edition of “The Little Dream Big”.<br><br>Seven editions later, the annual event keeps supporting the little ones with the help and contribution of numerous famous artists.</p></section>
